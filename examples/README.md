This directory contains example designs. Each example design has a makefile,
while, when invoked as "make" in the directory, will build the example. In
most cases, the result is a .rpm or .swix file which can be installed on
an Arista switch as an extension.

All files in this directory are licensed under a [3-clause BSD license](./LICENSE.md), to allow
use under that license.
